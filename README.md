# Environment

This repo contains my personal environment configurations and some dev notes

It is composed of mmostly bash scripts and configuration files

It tries to automate the most number of tasks and make the updates as fast as
possible

The focus is in:

- Productivity
- Simplicity
- Maintainability

Some of the principles in the repository:

- Creating the content of configuration files from bash scripts instead of from having dotfiles
    - Minimizing the configuration points boosts productivity
- Having a single big script file (~ 6k lines) instead of many smaller ones
    - One file eases editing and search
- Having code duplication in toolbox scripts
    - No interdependencies between scripts, very simple maintainability
