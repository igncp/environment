Review the content of the diff for the current changes by doing `GIT_PAGER='' git diff HEAD`. Summarize the changes and specially try to find obvious mistakes or quick wins. If you find any, suggest a fix for them. Don't include files inside "project" and consider them private. Then commit the changes using Traditional Chinese, preferably using Cantonese, giving a summary. Don't push to the remote. When commiting, don't add any extra co-authored line.
