# TODO ideas

## Specific

- Try Linux Autohot key alternative
- Scripts that can update current files for more complex changes (e.g. convert react class to function)

## Periodic

- Go through current config to remember
- Go through existing scripts to extend them
- Remove unused configs or move them to extras
